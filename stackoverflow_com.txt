I'm new to python and I'm following a video tutorial.

So here's the code snippet

    
    
    from urllib.request import urlopen
    with urlopen('http://sixty-north/c/t.txt') as story:
        story_words = []
        for line in story:
            line_words = line.decode('utf-8').split()
            for word in line_words:
                story_words.append(word)
    

I'm able to access ` http://sixty-north.com/c/t.txt ` in my browser.

However when I type this into command prompt: ` python words.py ` I get this
error:

There is no such host: ` sixty-north ` . Replace ` sixty-north ` with ` sixty-

Change host: ` sixty-north ` with ` sixty-north.com ` And also, Restart your
